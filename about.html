    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <p>
      Hi 👋 I’m a young creator who loves fitness, technology, and building things.
      I created this free workout generator to help people train anywhere,
      without equipment or expensive apps.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is built for learning, motivation, and healthy habits.
      All workouts are meant to be safe and adaptable.
      Always listen to your body.
    </p>

    <p>
      This app is 100% free and made as a personal project to learn web development,
      fitness programming, and digital creation.
